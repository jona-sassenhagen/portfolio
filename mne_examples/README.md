# Analysing EEG data with MNE-Python

[MNE-Python](http://www.martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html) is a free and open tool for
analyysing EEG and MEG data in Python. Two example notebooks show how to conduct both
typical and advanced analyses with MNE. The [example file](oddball-epo.fif) is included.

Tbd: update with the improved [EPOS workshop](https://github.com/jona-sassenhagen/mne_workshop_amsterdam).
